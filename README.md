# switchcases-in-python-
dekh bhai bada simple hai
look bro, this is very simple

switch cases is new feature introduced to python (java mein pehle se thi)
(existed java before itself)

isme na,in this, u specify diff cases after defining a function
i've took 1,2,3 & _ cases to keep it short and crsip
u take input from user and use it in ur defined function
the input is then equated to the cases 
when it finds a match
it gives that explicit output meant for that case
here if there are limited cases
last case can be left blank by an underscore and u r good to go
any case which doesn't match to ur defined cases 
the underscore case is gonna get executed
