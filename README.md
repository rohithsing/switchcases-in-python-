# switchcases-in-python-
dekh bhai bada simple hai
switch cases is new feature introduced to python (java mein pehle se thi)
isme na, u specify diff cases after defining a function
i've took 1,2,3 & _ cases to keep it short and crsip
u take input from user and use it in ur defined function
the input is then equated to the cases 
when it finds a match
it gives that explicit output meant for that case
here if there are limited cases
last case can be left blank by an underscore and u r good to go
any case which doesn't match to ur defined cases 
the underscore case is gonna get executed
